# Elliot
Elliot is a basic text editor made using C.
It runs on the command line/terminal.

I made it on a Linux(Ubuntu) Operating System and it runs fine on it.
On Windows, it shows missing header files and I have yet to find a way to fix that.

Though the code may be similar to `kilo.c` mentioned in the credits I plan to add some stuff in the future. 

## TO DO
- [ ] Add list here

## How to Use 
To use the text editor just compile and run the `elliot.c` file.
This repository also contains a `Makefile`, an `example.c` file made using this editor and an output file of the code `elliot`. 

## Credit
I made this text editor as a project by following a tutorial 
[**_kilo.c_**](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) .
The source repository of this tutorial is [**_Repository_**](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-src/tree/master).

P.S. If I need some sort of Licensing then please show me what to do.
