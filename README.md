# Elliot

Elliot is a basic text editor made using C.
It runs on the command line/terminal.

I made it on a Linux(Ubuntu) Operating System and it runs fine on it.

I made this text editor as a project by following a tutorial 
[**_kilo.c_**](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html) .
The source repository of this tutorial is [**_Repository_**](https://github.com/snaptoken/kilo-src/tree/master).
